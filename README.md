Developed a Python-based image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques, allowing users to securely encrypt and decrypt images with a custom key.

# Image Encryption & Decryption Tool Using Python

This project demonstrates a simple image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by performing basic mathematical operations on each pixel's RGB values.

## Features:
- Encrypt an image using a user-defined key.
- Decrypt an encrypted image using the same key.
- Supports most image formats like PNG, JPEG, BMP, and others.

## How It Works:
- **Encryption**: Each pixel's RGB values are shifted by the encryption key provided by the user. The result is saved as an encrypted image.
- **Decryption**: The encrypted image is restored to its original form by applying the reverse operation using the same key.

## Setup & Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UsmanMalik13/PRODIGY_CS_02.git
